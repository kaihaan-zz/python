I started learning about Python for data science - and tried to import some worl bank data to experiment on.

And immediately hit a problem - I could get from XML to Python's Pandas DataFrame format, so spent a few days getting to this...

Its very flabby and low on exception handling - any tips, adive, improvements etc very very welcome :-)
